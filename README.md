# xrd-clustering

This repository contains the functions necessary to process a tar file containing XRD data and a file giving coordinates that correspond to the points in that tar file. These functions transform these files into a dictionary, implement a clustering algorithm on the data, and return the bounds of a cluster that the user selected.
